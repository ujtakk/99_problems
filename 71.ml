(*
 * 71.Â Determine the internal path length of a tree. (*easy*)
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * We define the internal path length of a multiway tree as the total sum
 * of the path lengths from the root to all nodes of the tree. By this
 * definition, the tree `t` in the figure of the previous problem has an
 * internal path length of 9. Write a function `ipl tree` that returns the
 * internal path length of `tree`.
 *
 * # ipl t;;
 * - : int = 9
