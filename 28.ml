(*
 * 28.Â Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists. (*medium*)
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * 1.  We suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves.
 *     The objective is to sort the elements of this list according to
 *     their length. E.g. short lists first, longer lists later, or vice
 *     versa.
 *
 * 2.  Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are lists
 *     themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements of
 *     this list according to their **length frequency**; i.e., in the
 *     default, where sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare lengths
 *     are placed first, others with a more frequent length come later.
 *
 * # length_sort [ ["a";"b";"c"]; ["d";"e"]; ["f";"g";"h"]; ["d";"e"];
 *                 ["i";"j";"k";"l"]; ["m";"n"]; ["o"] ];;
 * - : string list list =
 * [["o"]; ["d"; "e"]; ["d"; "e"]; ["m"; "n"]; ["a"; "b"; "c"]; ["f"; "g"; "h"];
 *  ["i"; "j"; "k"; "l"]]
 * # frequency_sort [ ["a";"b";"c"]; ["d";"e"]; ["f";"g";"h"]; ["d";"e"];
 *                    ["i";"j";"k";"l"]; ["m";"n"]; ["o"] ];;
 * - : string list list =
 * [["i"; "j"; "k"; "l"]; ["o"]; ["a"; "b"; "c"]; ["f"; "g"; "h"]; ["d"; "e"];
 *  ["d"; "e"]; ["m"; "n"]]
