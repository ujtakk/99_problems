(*
 * 27.Â Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets. (*medium*)
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * 1.  In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint
 *     subgroups of 2, 3 and 4 persons? Write a function that generates all
 *     the possibilities and returns them in a list.
 * 2.  Generalize the above function in a way that we can specify a list of
 *     group sizes and the function will return a list of groups.
 *
 * # group ["a";"b";"c";"d"] [2;1];;
 * - : string list list list =
 * [[["a"; "b"]; ["c"]]; [["a"; "c"]; ["b"]]; [["b"; "c"]; ["a"]];
 *  [["a"; "b"]; ["d"]]; [["a"; "c"]; ["d"]]; [["b"; "c"]; ["d"]];
 *  [["a"; "d"]; ["b"]]; [["b"; "d"]; ["a"]]; [["a"; "d"]; ["c"]];
 *  [["b"; "d"]; ["c"]]; [["c"; "d"]; ["a"]]; [["c"; "d"]; ["b"]]]
