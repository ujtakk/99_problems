 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * Modify the result of the previous problem in such a way that if an
 * element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only
 * elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.
 *
 * Since OCaml lists are homogeneous, one needs to define a type to hold
 * both single elements and sub-lists.
 *
 *     # type 'a rle =
 *         | One of 'a
 *         | Many of int * 'a;;
 *     type 'a rle = One of 'a | Many of int * 'a
 *
 *     # encode ["a";"a";"a";"a";"b";"c";"c";"a";"a";"d";"e";"e";"e";"e"];;
