(*
 * 73.Â Lisp-like tree representation. (*medium*)
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * There is a particular notation for multiway trees in Lisp. The picture
 * shows how multiway tree structures are represented in Lisp.
 *
 * ![](../../img/lisp-like-tree.png "Lisp representation of multiway
 * trees")
 *
 * Note that in the "lispy" notation a node with successors (children) in
 * the tree is always the first element in a list, followed by its
 * children. The "lispy" representation of a multiway tree is a sequence of
 * atoms and parentheses '(' and ')'. This is very close to the way trees
 * are represented in OCaml, except that no constructor `T` is used. Write
 * a function `lispy : char mult_tree -> string` that returns the lispy
 * notation of the tree.
 *
 * # lispy (T('a', []));;
 * - : string = "a"
 * # lispy (T('a', [T('b', [])]));;
 * - : string = "(a b)"
 * # lispy t;;
 * - : string = "(a (f g) c (b d e))"
