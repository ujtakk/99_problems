(*
 * 69. Dotstring representation of binary trees. (*medium*)
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * We consider again binary trees with nodes that are identified by single
 * lower-case letters, as in the example of problem “[A string
 * representation of binary
 * trees](#Astringrepresentationofbinarytreesmedium)”. Such a tree can be
 * represented by the preorder sequence of its nodes in which dots (.) are
 * inserted where an empty subtree (nil) is encountered during the tree
 * traversal. For example, the tree shown in problem “[A string
 * representation of binary
 * trees](#Astringrepresentationofbinarytreesmedium)” is represented as
 * 'abd..e..c.fg...'. First, try to establish a syntax (BNF or syntax
 * diagrams) and then write a function `tree_dotstring` which does the
 * conversion in both directions. Use difference lists.
 *
 * (* solution pending *)
