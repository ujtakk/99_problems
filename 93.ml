(*
 * 93.Â Von Koch's conjecture. (*hard*)
 *******************************************************************************
 *
 * Several years ago I met a mathematician who was intrigued by a problem
 * for which he didn't know a solution. His name was Von Koch, and I don't
 * know whether the problem has been solved since.
 *
 * ![](../../img/von-koch1.gif "Tree numbering")
 *
 * Anyway, the puzzle goes like this: Given a tree with N nodes (and hence
 * N-1 edges). Find a way to enumerate the nodes from 1 to N and,
 * accordingly, the edges from 1 to N-1 in such a way, that for each edge K
 * the difference of its node numbers equals to K. The conjecture is that
 * this is always possible.
 *
 * For small trees the problem is easy to solve by hand. However, for
 * larger trees, and 14 is already very large, it is extremely difficult to
 * find a solution. And remember, we don't know for sure whether there is
 * always a solution!
 *

 *
 * Write a function that calculates a numbering scheme for a given tree.
 * What is the solution for the larger tree pictured here?
